# Test

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Conda environments

List the Conda environments.

```{r}
library(reticulate)
options(reticulate.repl.quiet = TRUE)

conda_list(conda = "auto")
```

Activate the environment `sage-bionetworks`.

```{r}
use_condaenv("sage-bionetworks", required = TRUE)
```

# Combining R and Python

Define a variable in R.

```{r}
counter <- 1
```

Access R objects in Python code blocks using the prefix `r.`.

```{python}
r.counter += 1
message = 'hello-world'
```

Resume working with the variable `a` in R.

```{r}
counter
```

Access Python objects in R code blocks using the prefix `py$`.

```{r}
py$message
```
